### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Gabriel. I am an associate professor in the Department of Health Technology at the Technical University of Denmark ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°. I am mostly interested in Bayesian/maximum-likelihood methods applied to modern and ancient DNA and sequencing in general.

You will find different repositories for various software I have coded with various collaborators. If you have any trouble (bug, installation, weird results), feel free to create an issue. I accept/welcome pull requests ðŸ˜‰.
